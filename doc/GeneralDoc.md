## Workflow

For this project we chose the Kanban methodology, were work items are visually represented on a "kanban board"; 
especifically we opted for a virtual board. In order to do that we used Microsoft Planner, were we created a team.
Later, we proceeded to assign all the tasks to the corresponding members for them to start working until everything
was completed.
