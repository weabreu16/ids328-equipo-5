#Branching strategy

We selected the GitHub Flow branching strategy for this project. This strategy is really simple as it only contains one primary branch, which is Main, and
any other change is made in a new branch deriving from Main with the name "feature" followed by a brief description. We also decided to add devOps branches
in order to implement any changes to the documentation and configuration of the project, as well as the automation of tasks.
